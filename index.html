 <h2 class="ContentBoxHead">Introduction to Mednafen</h2>
 <div class="ContentBoxBody">
 <p>
 Mednafen is a portable, utilizing OpenGL and SDL, argument(command-line)-driven multi-system emulator.
 Mednafen has the ability to remap hotkey functions and virtual system inputs to a keyboard, a joystick, or both simultaneously.  Save states are supported, as is real-time game rewinding.
 Screen snapshots may be taken, in the <a href="http://libpng.org/">PNG</a> file format, at the press of a button.  Mednafen can record
 audiovisual movies in the QuickTime file format, with <a href="/documentation/#qtrecord.vcodec">several different lossless codecs</a> supported.
 </p>
 <p>
 The following systems are supported(refer to the emulation module documentation for more details):
 <ul>
  <li>Atari Lynx</li>
  <li>Neo Geo Pocket (Color)</li>
  <li>WonderSwan</li>
  <li>GameBoy (Color)</li>
  <li>GameBoy Advance</li>
  <li>Nintendo Entertainment System</li>
  <li>Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom</li>
  <li>Virtual Boy</li>
  <li>PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 (CD)</li>
  <li>SuperGrafx</li>
  <li>PC-FX</li>
  <li>Sega Game Gear</li>
  <li>Sega Genesis/Megadrive</li>
  <li>Sega Master System</li>
  <li>Sega Saturn <i>(experimental, x86_64 only)</i></li>
  <li>Sony PlayStation</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 Mednafen is distributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU GPLv2</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Due to the threaded model of emulation used in Mednafen, and limitations of SDL, a joystick is preferred over a keyboard to play games,
 as the joystick will have slightly less latency, although the latency differences may not be perceptible to most people.

<ul>
<li>Migrated to SDL2(building from source requires 2.0.5+).

<li>An attempt to run an instance of Mednafen while another instance is already running with the same base directory is now blocked during startup, via a lock file; note that this check occurs after stdout and stderr are potentially redirected to stdout.txt and stderr.txt on Windows.

<li>Removed the &quot;overlay&quot; video driver.

<li>Changed the default value of setting &quot;video.driver&quot; from &quot;opengl&quot; to &quot;default&quot;, removed the old &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; backwards-compatibility value aliases, renamed the &quot;sdl&quot; driver to &quot;softfb&quot;(without backwards-compat aliases), and made it so the setting's value will be reset to &quot;default&quot; after automatically importing settings from &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot;.

<li>Added setting &quot;video.fs.display&quot;.

<li>Added settings &quot;fps.autoenable&quot;, &quot;fps.position&quot;, &quot;fps.scale&quot;, &quot;fps.font&quot;, &quot;fps.textcolor&quot;, and &quot;fps.bgcolor&quot;.

<li>Added support for pasting text into the cheat and netplay consoles.

<li>On Windows, Mednafen will now output text to a console if it's started from a console(e.g. cmd.exe or Cygwin), and if not, write to stdout.txt and stderr.txt like before.

<li>On Windows, error messages during startup will now be displayed in a popup message box.

<li><font color="yellow">On Windows, Mednafen now uses Unicode variants of CRT and Win32 functions; this may require the user to update path settings and convert their CUE sheets to UTF-8 if filenames use exotic(e.g. not directly typable on a standard US-layout keyboard) characters.</font>

<li>For key bindings relating to the debugger and cheat management interface, the Right ALT key modifier will no longer be respected(only the Left ALT has	any effect now), for internationalization reasons.

<li><font color="yellow">Configuration file is now named &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; again, instead of &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot;; if &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; doesn't exist or is for an old version(earlier than 0.9.0) of Mednafen, the settings will be loaded from &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot; on startup, but still saved to &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; on exit.</font>

<li>Reworked the input mapping setting format to be more human-readable(and editable).  Details are in the documentation, in the &quot;Advanced Usage&quot; section.  <font color="yellow">Old input mappings will be translated internally, except for keyboard mappings, due to incompatibilities between how SDL 1.2 and 2 handle keyboards.</font>

<li>Added support for mapping joystick axes and buttons, mouse buttons, and keyboard keys to emulated mouse device relative motion for testing purposes(via	manually editing the configuration file, as the in-emulator configuration process currently won't create such mappings).

<li>Added support for digital button input mappings that mix AND, ANDNOT, and OR-style operations together(previously it was either just AND or OR); refer to the documentation for more details.  Note that the in-emulator configuration process won't create complex mappings that mix different boolean operations, but you can map combinations using simpler logic in-emulator, and then edit the configuration file to adjust the boolean operations used.

<li><font color="yellow">Altered calculations involving *.xscale(fs)/*.yscale(fs) settings to be more predictable given floating point nuances; any user using non-integer scaling values for these settings may need to adjust them to get the same result as in previous versions of Mednafen, however.</font>

-- 1.21.0-UNSTABLE: --

February 19, 2018:
	An attempt to run an instance of Mednafen while another instance is already running with the same base directory is now blocked during startup, via
	a lock file; note that this check occurs after stdout and stderr are potentially redirected to stdout.txt and stderr.txt on Windows.

February 15, 2018:
	Changed the default value of setting &quot;video.driver&quot; from &quot;opengl&quot; to &quot;default&quot;, removed the old &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; backwards-compatibility value aliases,
	renamed the &quot;sdl&quot; driver to &quot;softfb&quot;(without backwards-compat aliases), and made it so the setting's value will be reset to &quot;default&quot; after 
	automatically importing settings from &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot;.

	On Windows, no longer exit on ALT+F4 while input is grabbed.

	Added settings &quot;fps.autoenable&quot;, &quot;fps.position&quot;, &quot;fps.textcolor&quot;, and &quot;fps.bgcolor&quot;.

February 11, 2018:
	Removed reliance on malloc(), realloc(), and calloc() setting errno to ENOMEM on failure, since it's not the case on Windows XP, and possibly other
	platforms/operating systems too.

February 9, 2018:
	ZIP files are now recognized by file extension instead of by magic(wizards).

	Replaced old minizip code with newly-written ZIP archive reading code.

	Replaced MDFN_PrintError() and MDFN_DispMessage() with MDFN_Notify().

February 6, 2018:
	Use versionsort() instead of alphasort() when scanning for js* joystick devices on Linux.

February 1, 2018:
	Added settings &quot;fps.scale&quot; and &quot;fps.font&quot;.

January 31, 2018:
	On Windows, in-memory conversion of M3U and CUE files to UTF-8 will be attempted if they lack a UTF-8 BOM and contain byte sequences that are not
	valid UTF-8.

	On Windows, path/filename settings loaded from the old mednafen-09x.cfg(before being saved to mednafen.cfg on exit) will now be converted to UTF-8.

January 29, 2018:
	Added support for pasting text into the cheat and netplay consoles.

January 28, 2018:
	SS: Added Japanese keyboard emulation.

	SS: Improved VDP2 window Y coordinate evaluation emulation; fixes at least one background layer graphical glitch
	in &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;(at the start of stage 2C), and the graphical glitch near the end of the intro in &quot;Snatcher&quot;.

January 20, 2018:
	Altered calculations involving *.xscale(fs)/*.yscale(fs) settings to be more predictable given floating point nuances; any user using non-integer scaling values
	for these settings may need to adjust them to get the same result as in previous versions of Mednafen, however.

	Added setting &quot;video.fs.display&quot;.

January 18, 2018:
	SDL2(2.0.5+) is now used and required.

	Removed the &quot;overlay&quot; video driver.

	On Windows, error messages during startup will now be displayed in a popup message box.

	On Windows, Mednafen will now output text to a console if it's started from a console(e.g. cmd.exe or Cygwin), and if not, write
	to stdout.txt and stderr.txt like before.

	On Windows, Mednafen now uses Unicode variants of CRT and Win32 functions; this may require the user to convert their CUE sheets to UTF-8 if filenames use
	exotic(e.g. not directly typable on a standard US-layout keyboard) characters.

	For key bindings relating to the debugger and cheat management interface, the Right ALT key modifier will no longer be respected(only the Left ALT has
	any effect now), for internationalization reasons.

	The configuration file is back to &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; instead of &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot;.  If a 0.8.x &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; is in the way, it will be renamed.  If &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot;
	does not exist, or is from an old version of Mednafen, settings will initially be loaded from &quot;mednafen-09x.cfg&quot;, but still saved to &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; on exit(and
	loaded from &quot;mednafen.cfg&quot; from that point on).

	Reworked the input mapping setting format to be more human-readable(and editable).  Details are in the documentation, in the &quot;Advanced Usage&quot; section.  Old
	input mappings will be translated internally, except for keyboard mappings, due to incompatibilities between how SDL 1.2 and 2 handle keyboards.

	Added support for mapping joystick axes and buttons, mouse buttons, and keyboard keys to emulated mouse device relative motion for testing purposes(via
	manually editing the configuration file, as the in-emulator configuration process currently won't create such mappings).

	Added support for digital button input mappings that mix AND, ANDNOT, and OR-style operations together(previously it was either just AND or OR); refer to the
	documentation for more details.  Note that the in-emulator configuration process won't create complex mappings that mix different boolean operations, 
	but you can map combinations using simpler logic in-emulator, and then edit the configuration file to adjust the boolean operations used.

January 15, 2018:
	SS: Fixed a bug that caused a crash if an error occurred early in the process of loading a game.

	Updated the configure script to disable gcc's mitigations for Spectre, in the event distributions configure their compilers to enable them by default.

	Stopped (erroneously) memset()'ing some MDFN_PixelFormat objects.

January 12, 2018:
	Cleaned up the handling and reduced the size of axis-related inputs as communicated from the driver-side code to core Mednafen.

	PCE_FAST: Fixed fubared mouse emulation.

December 28, 2017:
	Replaced usage of strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() with MDFN_strazicmp(), for consistent behavior across locales.

	Added MDFN_strazlower(), MDFN_strazupper(), MDFN_memazicmp(), and MDFN_strazicmp() functions.

December 14, 2017:
	SS: Fixed a logic error in the BIOS sanity check code that caused it to throw a less helpful error message than intended in certain circumstances, and
	made the error messages related to BIOS file misconfiguration more verbose(and hopefully more helpful...).

December 6, 2017:
	Fixed broken cheat file saving on MS Windows.

November 12, 2017:
	Changed how some multidimensional arrays and arrays of structs are accessed, to try to avoid behavior that's probably undefined and may be a problem
	in the future.

	PC-FX: Fixed integer overflows that caused fatal division by zero when Mednafen's cheat functionality was used(a regression introduced around 0.9.39).

	SS: Stuck SCU DMA table arrays in a struct to avoid unspecified behavior in the SCU save state code.

-- 0.9.47: --

August 25, 2017:
	Lynx, MD, NGP, SMS: Added a few missing variables to save states.

August 24, 2017:
	SS: Added save state support.

	Revamped save state helper macros and functions, to allow save-stating of variables in arrays of structs to be simpler.

August 22, 2017:
	SS: Fixed BCR1 write protect, and added stub emulation of the other BSC registers.

	SS: Added incomplete stub Action Replay 4M Plus emulation(for experimentation); proper Action Replay support would require SH-2 UBC emulation, and that
	may be too costly performance wise.

August 21, 2017:
	SS: Implemented very rough approximation of bus timing side effects when master SH-2 DMA is active(accurate handling of bus priorities and sharing would increase
	CPU requirements noticeably, but it may ultimately be necessary as a database-driven option for some stubborn games in the future).  Fixes startup hangs in
	&quot;Device Reign&quot;, &quot;Real Sound&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;SD Gundam G Century S&quot;, &quot;Super Tempo&quot;, &quot;Tennis Arena&quot;, &quot;Tilk&quot;, &quot;Yuukyuu Gensoukyoku&quot;,

<div class="pre"><pre>
-- 0.9.45: --

May 29, 2017:
	Tweaked netplay sound buffer underrun kludge code.

	The netplay server host and port being connected to are now printed to the netplay console at the beginning of a
	connection attempt.

	Netplay connection attempts to servers are now non-blocking.

May 25, 2017:
	SS: Synchronize end of SMPC clock change commands to beginning of vsync instead of beginning of vblank, per tests on a SS.

	SS: Added emulation of the light gun(&quot;Stunner&quot;/&quot;Virtua Gun&quot;).

April 28, 2017:
	#include'd many commonly-used C and C++ standard library headers in types.h(and removed redundant #include statements 
	from various header and source files), to reduce the probability of portability problems
	(due to neglecting to explicitly include a header file) when different standard C/C++ libraries
	behave differently in regards to what header files include what other header files.

	Added a sound output driver for OpenBSD's /dev/audio.

	Reworked the sound output format conversion code to be more versatile, 

April 25, 2017:
	NES: Wrote new &quot;Barcode Battler II&quot; emulation code to replace the old &quot;Barcode World&quot; code, based on quick testing with
	actual hardware(albeit the English version).

April 24, 2017:
	SSFPlay: Added save state support.

-- 0.9.44.1: --

April 21, 2017:
	MD: Added a missing MDFN_FASTCALL, the absence of which broke 32-bit x86 builds(either at link time or run time).

-- 0.9.44: --

April 19, 2017:
	PSX: Restructured the GPU emulation code and data a bit to get a minor performance boost.

April 18, 2017:
	VB, PCE, WonderSwan, MD, GBA: Use fastcall calling convention(on 32-bit x86) in a few (more) places where it makes sense.

April 16, 2017:
	SNES-Faust: Added setting &quot;snes_faust.correct_aspect&quot;, default value of &quot;1&quot;.

	SNES-Faust: Added PAL support.

April 14, 2017:
	SNES-Faust: Made minor optimizations to the BG rendering code.

April 9, 2017:
	Added command-line option &quot;-which_medium&quot;, to specify which CD to start with when using multi-CD M3U sets.

April 5, 2017:
	SNES: Fixed emulator hang when saving state in &quot;Panic Bomber W&quot;.

April 3, 2017:
	Added some simple scripts to cross-compile and package Mednafen for Windows.

	Added Windows cross-compiler toolchain setup notes.

	32-bit Windows builds are now compiled with -march=i686 instead of -march=i586(shouldn't affect compatibility for official builds, since the toolchain
	and libraries were already effectively being compiled with -march=i686, which was not intended, but since nobody apparently complained... ;p).

March 25, 2017:
	VB: Added support for custom palettes.

	VB: Reworked how LED on-state duration is translated into RGB values and added setting &quot;vb.ledonscale&quot;; the default value of &quot;vb.ledonscale&quot; is
	set such that the overall brightness will be lower than in previous versions of Mednafen, to reduce white crush, but the user can set it
	to a value of &quot;1.9921875&quot; to approximate the old brightness level.

March 20, 2017:
	SNES: Made a couple of SDD1 registers readable; fixes &quot;Tractor Beam&quot; spell graphical glitches in &quot;Star Ocean&quot;(thanks to orbea).

March 17, 2017:
	SS: Added support for a 16MiB RAM cart mapped into the A-bus CS1 area(for &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and homebrew).

March 15, 2017:

	automatically rotate inputs when the display is rotated.

March 14, 2017:
	Reworked text drawing to not use an excessive number of potentially-large VLAs.

	Moved statements with important side effects outside of assert()s in settings.cpp.

	Replaced ancient Unicode conversion code with newly-developed code.

March 7, 2017:
	SS: Prioritize SMPC command execution over VBlank handler execution, per (limited) tests on a SS.  Fixes broken input in &quot;Primal Rage&quot;(a 0.9.43 regression).

	Reworked how keyboard key state is handled, to prevent extremely short button presses from being lost(like what can happen with the Pause key, or
	other keys when slow-forwarding is active).

	SS: Added 101-key US keyboard emulation.

February 17, 2017:
	SS: Allow SMPC commands to be dual-issued; fixes hang in &quot;F1 Challenge&quot;, and hangs/missing sound in &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;.

	SS: Added emulation of the 6-Player Adaptor(multitap).

February 15, 2017:
	SS: Added emulation of the Mission Stick and Dual Mission Sticks.

February 13, 2017:
	SS: Added emulation of the steering wheel(&quot;Arcade Racer&quot;), for use with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, &quot;High Velocity - Mountain Racing Challenge&quot;,
	&quot;The Need for Speed&quot;, and other Saturn racing games that apparently lack 3D pad support.

February 7, 2017:

	graphical glitches in &quot;All-Star Baseball 97&quot;.

February 6, 2017:
	SS: Ignore writes to VDP1 registers via SCU DMA under certain conditions to approximate what happens on a SS; fixes hang in &quot;GunBlaze-S&quot;.

	SS: Fixed handling of RSTCSR WOVF clearing, per tests on a SS.  Also changed the semantics of RSTCSRM a bit to simplify things, might want to change
	WTCSRM, FTCSRM, etc. semantics too in the future for consistency...

	Updated tremor to revision 19427.

January 31, 2017:
	SS: Fixed handling of clearing FTCSR bits, per tests on a SS.

January 30, 2017:
	SS: Improved instruction timing(though still far from perfect); fixes speed problems in &quot;Pocket Fighter&quot;, reduces the size of the flickering
	area in &quot;Lunar&quot;'s FMV, and fixes the crash that occurs immediately after gameplay starts in &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot;.

	NES: Added support for iNES mapper 190.

January 25, 2017:
